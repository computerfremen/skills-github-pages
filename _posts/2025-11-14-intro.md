So, here I am, in front of a blank text editor, trying to get the first line of my blog's project going. I'm not a native English speaker, as I'm sure you've noticed, but I'm starting this space to try to achieve two goals:
- To dump all my ideas in a non-volatile space.
Now that this entry has made me think about it, I've realized that the way I like to take notes sometimes turns into something mandatory. I start to feel like I'd miss out on ideas and emotions if I didn't take notes. I started using the iPhone's notes a few years ago to journal, record ideas on the bus, and write down things I couldn't say. That way I discovered how helpful journalism is; it brings order sometimes even when you are not finding it in your head—just dump it. When I started working in the DFIR field, I was hit with a ton of information to process. An old colleague (shoutout to Manu, aka teletexter) put me on to Obsidian Project and Markdown, which really helped. That tool totally changed the way I collect and structure information.

- To improve my English skills.
It'd be way easier for me if I wrote it in Spanish, my native language. But isn't that the whole point? I want to reach the widest audience possible, and since I read 99% of all the technical content in English, I just wanted to contribute. It's also a great way to improve my writing skills. It even limits my production, but I don't care. I hope you don't either.
